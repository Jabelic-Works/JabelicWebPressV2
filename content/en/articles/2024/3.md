# I Have Graduated from grad school.
I attended the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology for Graduate Studies, commonly known as AIIT. This spring, I was able to graduate.

## About AIIT
AIIT is a graduate school for working adults, offering three courses:

- Creative Technology Course
- Information Architecture Course
- Business Design Engineering Course

I was enrolled in the "Information Architecture Course."

## What I Did :thinking:
In the first year, I attended lectures. As a master's student, I needed to earn all my credits in the first year, which was the plan.

In the second year, I participated in Project-Based Learning (PBL). I was part of an Agile project team (PT), learning and developing through Scrum development.

The product we developed was a "system for recommending alternatives to discontinued cosmetics." There were issues with data and straightforward manpower problems, which meant things did not go very smoothly, but we managed to shape it into a product nonetheless.

The product was offered as a web service, using Rails for the API and Next.js's App Router for the frontend. We started using the App Router about a month after its release, adding challenging elements to our project.

## What I Gained from AIIT and PBL
First, I was able to define my specialty in the software field.

In my undergraduate studies, I focused on numerical calculations and dynamical systems, so I had virtually no expertise in software. Although I had some practical experience, obtaining a degree to formally demonstrate my expertise in software was significant.

The year-long project on Scrum and Agile, topics I was completely unfamiliar with, provided a great opportunity. Before studying Agile Scrum, I understood that Scrum development methods were effective and I tried to comprehend them, but I didn't have the passion to choose it as a specialty. Rather, I was more interested in focusing on web technologies.

However, a year of activity and learning made the importance of systematic approaches and communication clearer. Indeed, there's a lot to understand through experience that you can't get just from reading books, and gaining these real experiences was truly valuable.

I've also become eager to explain the effectiveness of Agile Scrum to many people, so I've started compiling it in Agile Note. I've only written about half of it so far, and I plan to change the structure probably.

## Would I Recommend AIIT to Others?
AIIT is a graduate school for working adults.

For those in the information field who wish to pursue a degree, I highly recommend it as a practical option.

Reasons include:

- The "Credit Banking System" allows you to earn credits before enrollment, reducing the risk of dropping out due to insufficient - credits.
- There is a long-term enrollment system.
- Many entrance examinations are conducted, allowing for multiple attempts.
- The field is broad, with a variety of lectures related to the information field.

However, I might not actively recommend it to those who:

- Want to conduct academic research.
- Want to pursue a Ph.D. over five years.
## Looking Forward
Having studied Agile, I am considering making it the core of my career along with Web FrontEnd.
