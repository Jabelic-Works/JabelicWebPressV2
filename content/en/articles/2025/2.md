# Japanese Phone Numbers

This article outlines the basic rules of Japanese phone numbers and how to convert them for international calling.

## Phone Number Structure

Japanese phone numbers start with "0". This "0" is called the domestic prefix and serves as an identifier for domestic calls.

Example of a Tokyo phone number: `03-1234-5678`
- "0": Domestic prefix
- "3": Tokyo area code
- "1234": Local exchange code
- "5678": Subscriber number

## Numbers That Don't Start With 0

There are some phone numbers in Japan that don't start with "0":

- Emergency numbers and special service numbers: "110" (police), "119" (fire/ambulance), "104" (directory assistance) start with "1"
- Local calls: Within the same area, you can omit the area code, resulting in numbers that start with "2-9" (For example, within Tokyo's 23 wards, you can dial "2222-5678" without the "03" prefix)

However, when considering the complete number, the basic format starts with "0".

## International Number Conversion

The rule for converting Japanese phone numbers to international format:
"Remove the leading 0 and add the country code +81"

Example:
- Domestic format: 090-1234-5678
- International format: +81-90-1234-5678

This conversion is necessary because the "0" is a domestic call prefix. For international calls, country codes are used, making the domestic prefix unnecessary.

Globally, many countries use "0" as their domestic call prefix, and it's common practice to omit this "0" when making international calls.

## International Calling and International Prefixes

### What is an International Prefix?

An international prefix is the number dialed first when making an international call. It serves as a signal indicating "I'm making an international call." Different countries have different international prefixes, which instruct the telephone system to connect to international lines.

### International Prefixes in Major Countries

International prefixes vary by country:
- Japan: 010
- United States and Canada: 011
- United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, China, etc.: 00
- Australia: 0011

### Using the "+" Symbol on Mobile Phones

Most mobile phones allow the use of the "+" symbol (plus sign), which works universally regardless of which country you're calling from. This "+" replaces the international prefix, and the phone automatically converts it to the appropriate international prefix.

Example:
- When entering `+81-90-1234-5678`, a phone in Japan would convert it to "010-81-90-1234-5678"
- A phone in the US would convert it to "011-81-90-1234-5678"

### Calling from Japan to Overseas

"International prefix (010) + Destination country code + Destination phone number (omit any leading 0)"

Example: Calling New York, USA (212-456-7890)
"010-1-212-456-7890"

### Calling Japan from Overseas

"That country's international prefix + Japan's country code (81) + Japanese phone number (omit the leading 0)"

Example: Calling Tokyo (03-1234-5678) from the USA
"011-81-3-1234-5678"

### Making International Calls from Hotels or Offices

When making calls from hotel or office internal phone systems, you may need to dial an additional number (often "0" or "9") before the international prefix to access an outside line.

Example: Calling the USA from a hotel where "0" is needed for an outside line
"0-010-1-212-456-7890"
